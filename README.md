# Decentralized Trade Credit Insurance Protocol

## Overview

The Decentralized Trade Credit Insurance (DTCI) protocol is a blockchain-based solution that provides businesses with protection against non-payment risks in trade transactions. By leveraging smart contracts and decentralized verification, the protocol offers a transparent, efficient alternative to traditional trade credit insurance.

## Core Components

### Buyer Verification Contract
This contract validates the financial stability and creditworthiness of purchasers before approving coverage. It aggregates data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive risk profile for each buyer.

### Transaction Registration Contract
Businesses use this contract to record details of credit sales that require insurance coverage. The contract stores essential information such as transaction value, payment terms, and parties involved.

### Risk Assessment Contract
The protocol's risk assessment engine evaluates the likelihood of payment default for each registered transaction. It analyzes buyer history, market conditions, and transaction specifics to determine appropriate premium rates.

### Claim Processing Contract
If a buyer fails to pay within the agreed terms, suppliers can initiate claims through this contract. It verifies claim validity and manages compensation disbursement according to policy terms.
